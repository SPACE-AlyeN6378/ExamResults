# Learning Assignment - Exam Results

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to do object-oriented programming, practice coding conventions and data structures.

This Java program processes the results of an examination. There are three categories of files:
* Student information
* Subject and paper information
* Marks obtained

Each student gives exams for three subjects—Math, Physics and Chemistry. Math has one paper, while Physics and Chemistry have two papers each. In each paper, there are two parts—theoretical and practical. You have to tabulate each mark and produce the results in alphabetical order of students.
